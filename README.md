# Agricultural Robot List
A curated list of robot manufacturers, start-ups, implement providers and automation technologies for agriculture. The list is documented in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/daviderizzo-phd/agricultural-robot-list/wiki) of this repository. The list is structured to cover:
1. **sources of information**, 
2. the existing and upcoming **robots**
3. the **automation technologies**. 
4. some complementary resources to understand **digitalisation** of agriculture and the wider context of automation for this sector. 

This list will be curated with constant updates. 

A **bibliometric research** about agricultural robotics is documented on the [dedicated repository](https://github.com/daviderizzo-phd/agricultural-robotics)
