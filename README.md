# Agricultural Robot List
A curated list of robot manufacturers, start-ups, implement providers and automation technologies for agriculture. The list is structured to cover sources of information, the existing and upcoming robots,and the automation technologies. Finally, I added also relevant resources to understand digitalisation of agriculture and the wider context of automation for this sector. 
Agricultural robotics is rapidly under the pressure of some major trends: the increasing lack of labour, the societal pressure to improve by a greater precision or even reduce to zero the use of phytochemical, and the achievement of a favorable technology ecosystem. As such, this list will be curated with constant updates.  

## Sources of information
An increasing number of sources are becoming available on internet to learn about existing and upcoming agricultural robots. They can be grouped in three categories: curated databases and directories, documents, and projects  

### Databases and directories
- **[DuckSize](https://www.ducksize.com/)**, by [Corné Rispens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corne-rispens/) is the most specilized one, with videos of field tests and outdoor exhibitions 
- **[Aspexit](https://www.aspexit.com/en/)** by [Corentin Leroux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corentin-leroux-0225a182/) provided probably the first interactive map of agricultural robotics [available here](https://www.aspexit.com/la-robotique-en-agriculture/) (in French), now embedded in the new overwhelming and growing database of digital and technological solutions for agriculture ([link to the directory](https://www.lesoutilsnumeriquesdesagriculteurs.com/en/)). Here the link to the [section for robotis](https://www.lesoutilsnumeriquesdesagriculteurs.com/en/technologies/robotique/) 
- **[Agricultural Robotics](https://www.agricultural-robotics.com/)** by GOFAR is the top newsfeed website about agricultural robotics, constantly fed by the organisers of the yearly World Forum of Agricultural Robotics that achieved already 6th edition in 2022 ([FIRA](https://www.fira-agtech.com/))

### Documents
Documents about agricultural robotics include research articles and review, books and various types of reports and static lists.
