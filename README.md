# Agricultural Robot List
A curated list of robot manufacturers, start-ups, implement providers and automation technologies for agriculture. The list is documented in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/daviderizzo-phd/agricultural-robot-list/wiki) of this repository. The list is structured to cover **sources of information**, the existing and upcoming **robots**,and the **automation technologies**. Finally, I added also relevant resources to understand **digitalisation** of agriculture and the wider context of automation for this sector. This list will be curated with constant updates. 
A **bibliometric research** about agricultural robotics is documented on the [dedicated repository](https://github.com/daviderizzo-phd/agricultural-robotics)
